# Challenge 1: AJAX Atrocity

Asynchronous JavaScript and XML requests (AJAX) are crucial to web development. They allow programmers to access external resources, APIs, and processes without pausing the current page. To train you in this important skill, Clarity has task you with fixing these AJAX queries to the city's registry of graffiti removal requests. Study the `index.html` file in this directory and follow the comments to complete these flags.

## Flags

[ ] 01b: Fix the bad promise and print the results to #output-bad-promise.
[ ] 01c: Search for reports closed on 03/31/2017 of graffiti on unpainted brick and print the results to #output-brick-unpainted.
[ ] 01d: Make a call to 'https://data.cityofchicago.org/resource/byhn-gzba.json' and display the Socrata error code in #output-error.
