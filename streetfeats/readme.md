# Challenge 2: Street Feats

Clarity has tasked you with writing a web-based program to determine if input addresses are valid in the city of Chicago. To determine validity, you will need to make AJAX requests to the city's database of street addresses to check if the street name and street number are valid. A helper function `showResult(input, result)` exists for you to report the results. When you run `index.html` you will see the test case inputs: you do not have to prepare for inputs in different formats.

## Flags

- [ ] 02a: Pass "Address is Valid!" to showResult() if the address is valid.
- [ ] 02b: Pass "Address is Invalid!" to showResult() if the address is invalid.
- [ ] 02c: Pass "Street number does not exist." to showResult() if the street is valid but the number is not.
- [ ] 02d: Follow the rules from the previous flags to evaluate a set of mixed addresses.

## Judging

This challenge will be evaluated automatically. Open your browser console to see if you pass or fail the flags. Both the leaderboard and your team page should update in realtime with the results.
