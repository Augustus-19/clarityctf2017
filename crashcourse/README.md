The Chicago Tribune published [an article](http://www.chicagotribune.com/classified/automotive/chi-car-accident-what-to-do-next-112310-story.html) explaining how reporting information from a traffic crash can help participants avoid raised premiums with their insurers and ultimately, save money.

Your task is to create a form that will accept and submit information from participants in a traffic crash.
