# Challenge 19: Widget Contingent

The documentation for [Esri map widgets](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/sample-code/get-started-widgets/index.html) says:

> Some widgets are automatically made available to the MapView
> and SceneView by default, whereas others need to be manually
> added into the application.

Your task is to identify a widget not automatically added to Mapview and then create documentation around adding it to MapView.
