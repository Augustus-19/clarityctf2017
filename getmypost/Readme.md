**Difficulty:** Easy

Clarity has recently deployed a website for the Metra Train System. They need to find out the most active routes.

Your task will be to implement a program that uses the provided server logs to calculate the most active _get_ and _post_ routes.

    Your answer should be a string of the form `{Route},{No. of Requests}` eg. `www.abc.com/xyz,1234`
- 8b: Calculate the most used *POST* request route using the `Log 2` file.
    Your answer should be a string of the form `{Route},{No. of Requests}` eg. `www.abc.com/xyz,1234`
