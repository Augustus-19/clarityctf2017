# Challenge 13: Datepicker Disaster

Datepickers are a point of great debate for most web developers... everyone has their own library or plugin they prefer. But for this project, Clarity has been tasked with fixing a broken website that searches red light cameras in the city based on the date they were installed. This website uses pikaday.js and your job is to work with that library to upgrade the website.

## Flags

- [ ] 13a: Unbind datepicker from input and put it in `div#container`.
- [ ] 13b: Disable weekends on the datepicker.
- [ ] 13c: Restrict year range to be between 2004 and 2010.
- [ ] 13d: Get all red light cameras opened on 11/14/2008 and put the date in span#datedisplay in a format that follows: Tuesday April 4th, 2017.
- [ ] 13e: Get all red light cameras opened on 11/14/2008 and append each camera to ul#output as an `<li`>.
- [ ] 13f: Get all red light cameras opened on 11/14/2008 and display the intersection for each camera in its `<li>`.
